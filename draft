mnw is a wordpress plugin which adds openmicroblogging support to wordpress.

== Integration ==
mnw should use user informations (favicon as avatar, url, blogtitle as username) from wordpress and allow display of mu-messages (sidebar)

== Use cases ==
A user subscribes to the wordpress blog via omb. Notices from mnw are sent to the user's omb instance.

== How to add a custom page ==
add new page to theme, declare it as template
add a page based on the template

== Versions ==
0.1 should be able to send messages on new blog posts
1.0 should be able to send (arbitrary and on blog post) & receive (probably direct responses) messages. Display of them in widgets. Clean code.
Check all the (micro) formats which could be necessary
Additional features could be
- multiuser support
- configure post/page/comment broadcasting on a per-post/page base and in general
- customize notice format for post/page/comment notices
- url shortening! text shortening!
- add user setting to exclude subscribe page from all_pages

== Bugs ==
Push avatar
Subscribe page URL should be retrieved dynamically
omb service target links should use a smoother regexp
Delete users which are not subscribed anymore
Target after successful subscription should be chosen by user
User settings should be validated
Use better default omb_bio
Use user-agent

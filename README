mnw is a wordpress plugin which adds openmicroblogging support to wordpress.

== Installation ==
- Copy the plugin to your wordpressâ€˜ plugin directory.
- Copy one of the themepage.LANG.php files as mnw.php to the directory of your
  current theme.
- Adjust the mnw.php to fit to your theme (archives.php is a good start to see
  how your theme looks like on custom pages).
- Create a new page in wordpress. This page is the main frontend of your OMB
  instance. Give it a sensible name, keep the content empty and select 'mnw' as
  template. Publish this page.
- Activate the plugin.
- Configure the plugin in the corresponding admin menu.
- (Optional) Copy omb.png to the directory of your current theme. Enable the sidebar
  widget displaying a count of your omb subscribers.

Note that mnw is published under the GNU Affero General Public License. You have to
publish the source code for mnw. If you change nothing, just link to the mnw website.

== Current features ==
mnw gives users of an OMB service the possibility to subscribe to your blog directly.
Your blog will automatically send OMB notices to subscribers when you publish a new
post, page or attachment (configurable).
